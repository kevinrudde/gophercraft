Gophercraft is an open-source library that empowers developers to craft their own Minecraft server software, entirely written from scratch in Go.

The goal is to provide a comprehensive API specially crafted to enable effortless realization of limitless possibilities. By default no Vanilla features
will be implemented, everything will be in the hand of the developer.

Gophercraft is currently in development, do not expect to much in the current state of development.
